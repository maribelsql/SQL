# Maria's SQL Portfolio
**üó®Ô∏è Welcome to my SQL portfolio!**

This repository contains examples of SQL I've written as I dive deeper into the SQL world. It showcases my proficiency in SQL through various projects, exercises, and challenges.

As I progress, I‚Äôll continue adding projects that highlight my growth in:
- Data querying
- Data cleaning
- Aggregation & analysis
- Database design concepts

Each project will have its own folder with scripts, explanations, and notes.

**ü§ù Connecting**

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions on my work or to just talk about the world of SQL. Let's connect!
